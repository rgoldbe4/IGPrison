# IGPrison

## Project Description
This project is a Minecraft (Spigot) plugin developed in Java. 
The goal was to run a Minecraft server using this plugin to manage day-to-day interactions of users.
This project was also developed with IGWebsite (https://github.com/rgoldbe4/IGWebsite/) for an easy to access Admin Control Panel.
Lastly, this project was intended to have a donation shop in tandem with IGWebsite.

## Project Goals
1) Create a working plugin that handles interactions between the user and the server
2) Submit any usable data to the remote database to be analyzed

## Project Future Plans
1) Identify any outdated `SQLQuery` usage and transition it to Hibernate (https://hibernate.org/) completely
2) Normalize a few tables within the database to properly reflect ERM expectations from Hibernate
3) Convert project to Maven with working builds
4) Update Issues table with remaining issues from old project
5) Update MySQL with proper users (accounts are no longer existing) so plugin can access databases.

## To any future employer viewing this
This was intended as a fun project that I developed in Summer 2018. 
I worked with a friend to build this plugin based on the ideas we came up together. 
Additionally, we worked on identifying bugs and resolving them using agile methodology. 
We had two databases, one for local and one for production. This way I didn't actually break the server when I pushed an update!
However, based on obligations with school and previous employment, this project was never truly finished.
